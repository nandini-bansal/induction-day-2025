## Day 1: 30 July 2025
The Shabad Kirtan at the college gurudwara was a very peaceful and serene experience. The collective devotion of all the students brought a sense of faith and gratitude in me. Sitting there, I was lost in my prayer as I prayed for my success at a new chapter of life and for God to bring me amazing opportunities at my new college.<br/> 
<br/>
Next, in the auditorium, the inspiring speech by Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal, HOD, Department of Applied Sciences made me acknowledge how important it is to focus not only on freedom but studies as well to have a successful career. Her fixation on “structured freedom” was a new and vital concept that I got to know about.<br/> 
<br/>
The words spoken by Dr. Sehijpal Singh, Principal, were very insightful. While supporting us for giving full attention to our studies, he left no room for doubt on how our college shapes our future and that it was a thing of honour to be a student at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College.<br/> 
<br/>
Lastly, the address by the chief guest, Mr. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, was very inspiring. He gave information about how he is connected to the Nankana Sahib Education Trust and was ecstatic to be a part of the event. His captivating stories about his father and his brother forged an emotional bond with him while his stories told us how the students of GNDEC had reached great heights and someday, we could be like them too.<br/>
<br/>
The anchor also invited Mr. Harsimran to let us know about the history of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, which, all of us, were very proud to know about.<br/>
The department visit with seniors and teachers was the cherry on top as we saw our future labs and classrooms with a glimmer in our eyes. The airy and tall building of the college looked ready to accept us as the freshers of the year 2025. 

## Day 2: 1 August 2025
The second day of the college began with the insightful lecture by Dr. Priya Darshini on Universal Human Values which taught us a lot about our dreams, aspirations, and how the main goal in life is to be happy and prosperous, in continuity. Her interaction with the students made the lecture interesting and her words gave food for thought. The assigned activity for the same was also a fun task to do while at home. It kept us in touch with human values while at home.<br/>
<br/>
After this, the lecture on Personality Development by Dr. Arvind Dhingra was very intriguing. The information he gave about the societies and clubs of the college was not only alluring but very necessary for the new students. He made the session very engaging by inviting students over to the stage and having them play some games. The guidance given by him for interpersonal skills, body language and effective communication will definitely go a long way with us and would be very helpful in the days to come. His patient voice made the atmosphere comfortable for the freshers and brought a great final flourish to the speeches for the day.<br/> 
<br/>
After an hour-long break filled with food, finding the classrooms while being lost in the department and socialising with new people, we reached our classrooms where seniors conducted our proficiency tests of English and Mathematics. 

## Day 3: 4 August 2025
Today's day started with an amazing introduction given by the CAUSMIC CLUB to the freshers of 2025. The club members introduced us to the patrons and co-ordinators of the causmic club and then went on to explain the meaning behind the name which is an amalgamation of "cause" and "cosmic", since the club aimed at working for causes which held an important place in the universe. The club members then told us about the various events organised annually by them. I was impressed to know about the footfall at events like Acme and Ambit. They made the session even more interesting by showing us the reels that were made by them to spread word about the events. All of us were very happy and interested to join causmic club. <br/>
<br/>
Next, the anchor invited Mr. Gautam onstage who briefed us about motorsports and the world of racing. As a person who fondly watches Formula 1 racing, that session was pretty intriguing. Though, it was a short lecture, it was great to know the initiatives taken up by the teachers and students at the college to make it all inclusive. I was amazed to know that the motorsports teams from our college had participated in national level competitions like Baja. <br/>
<br/>
After the thrilling session, we were brought to a state of calm by Dr. Priya Darshini as she continued with her expert lecture on Universal Human Values. She spoke again about being happy and prosperous and how there is a difference between the needs of the body and the soul. She told us that the needs of our body were not to be confused with those of the soul. It was a very informative lecture all-in-all. <br/>
<br/>
Following the lectures in the auditorium and the break, all branches now had 2 classes. The scheduled classes of English and peer-to-peer Programming through problem solving using C++ of my section ECE-A were held in F-106. I sat with my new found friends and we listened intently as our English professor Mr. Aastik Sharma gave us 4 very interesting questions which revolved around our introduction and a letter to a friend. He then asked all of the students to, one-by-one, speak whatever they wrote in their introduction but without looking at the notebook. I was nervous at first, but then I spoke exactly what I had written and I felt confident. His class went by very fast. Next up, we had the PPS class which was conducted by our seniors from 2nd ad 3rd year. They taught us to write our first C++ program. They were very kind and helping. After the hour long class, we were now dismissed from the class and headed back home.<br/>
