## Day 1 - 30 July 2025
The Shabad Kirtan at the college gurudwara was a very peaceful and serene experience. The collective devotion of all the students brought a sense of faith and gratitude in me. Sitting there, I was lost in my prayer as I prayed for my success at a new chapter of life and for God to bring me amazing opportunities at my new college. 
Next, in the auditorium, the inspiring speech by Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal, HOD, Department of Applied Sciences made me acknowledge how important it is to focus not only on freedom but studies as well to have a successful career. Her fixation on “structured freedom” was a new and vital concept that I got to know about. 
The words spoken by Dr. Sehijpal Singh, Principal, were very insightful. While supporting us for giving full attention to our studies, he left no room for doubt on how our college shapes our future and that it was a thing of honour to be a student at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College. 
Lastly, the address by the chief guest, Mr. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, was very inspiring. He gave information about how he is connected to the Nankana Sahib Education Trust and was ecstatic to be a part of the event. His captivating stories about his father and his brother forged an emotional bond with him while his stories told us how the students of GNDEC had reached great heights and someday, we could be like them too. 
The department visit with seniors and teachers was the cherry on top as we saw our future labs and classrooms with a glimmer in our eyes. The airy and tall building of the college looked ready to accept us as the freshers of the year 2025. 

## Day 2 - 1 August 2025
The second day of the college began with the insightful lecture by Dr. Priya Darshini on Universal Human Values which taught us a lot about our dreams, aspirations, and how the main goal in life is to be happy and prosperous, in continuity. Her interaction with the students made the lecture interesting and her words gave food for thought. The assigned activity for the same was also a fun task to do while at home. It kept us in touch with human values while at home. 
After this, the lecture on Personality Development by Dr. Arvind Dhingra was very intriguing. The information he gave about the societies and clubs of the college was not only alluring but very necessary for the new students. He made the session very engaging by inviting students over to the stage and having them play some games. The guidance given by him for interpersonal skills, body language and effective communication will definitely go a long way with us and would be very helpful in the days to come. His patient voice made the atmosphere comfortable for the freshers and brought a great final flourish to the speeches for the day. 
After an hour-long break filled with food, finding the classrooms while being lost in the department and socialising with new people, we reached our classrooms where seniors conducted our proficiency tests of English and Mathematics.
