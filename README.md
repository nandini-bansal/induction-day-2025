## Day 1: 30 July 2025
The Shabad Kirtan at the college gurudwara was a very peaceful and serene experience. The collective devotion of all the students brought a sense of faith and gratitude in me. Sitting there, I was lost in my prayer as I prayed for my success at a new chapter of life and for God to bring me amazing opportunities at my new college.<br/> 
<br/>
Next, in the auditorium, the inspiring speech by Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal, HOD, Department of Applied Sciences made me acknowledge how important it is to focus not only on freedom but studies as well to have a successful career. Her fixation on “structured freedom” was a new and vital concept that I got to know about.<br/> 
<br/>
The words spoken by Dr. Sehijpal Singh, Principal, were very insightful. While supporting us for giving full attention to our studies, he left no room for doubt on how our college shapes our future and that it was a thing of honour to be a student at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College.<br/> 
<br/>
Lastly, the address by the chief guest, Mr. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, was very inspiring. He gave information about how he is connected to the Nankana Sahib Education Trust and was ecstatic to be a part of the event. His captivating stories about his father and his brother forged an emotional bond with him while his stories told us how the students of GNDEC had reached great heights and someday, we could be like them too.<br/>
<br/>
The anchor also invited Mr. Harsimran to let us know about the history of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, which, all of us, were very proud to know about.<br/>
The department visit with seniors and teachers was the cherry on top as we saw our future labs and classrooms with a glimmer in our eyes. The airy and tall building of the college looked ready to accept us as the freshers of the year 2025.

## Day 2: 1 August 2025
The second day of the college began with the insightful lecture by Dr. Priya Darshini on Universal Human Values which taught us a lot about our dreams, aspirations, and how the main goal in life is to be happy and prosperous, in continuity. Her interaction with the students made the lecture interesting and her words gave food for thought. The assigned activity for the same was also a fun task to do while at home. It kept us in touch with human values while at home.<br/>
<br/>
After this, the lecture on Personality Development by Dr. Arvind Dhingra was very intriguing. The information he gave about the societies and clubs of the college was not only alluring but very necessary for the new students. He made the session very engaging by inviting students over to the stage and having them play some games. The guidance given by him for interpersonal skills, body language and effective communication will definitely go a long way with us and would be very helpful in the days to come. His patient voice made the atmosphere comfortable for the freshers and brought a great final flourish to the speeches for the day.<br/> 
<br/>
After an hour-long break filled with food, finding the classrooms while being lost in the department and socializing with new people, we reached our classrooms where seniors conducted our proficiency tests of English and Mathematics. 

## Day 3: 4 August 2025
Today's day started with an amazing introduction given by the CAUSMIC CLUB to the freshers of 2025. The club members introduced us to the patrons and co-ordinators of the causmic club and then went on to explain the meaning behind the name which is an amalgamation of "cause" and "cosmic", since the club aimed at working for causes which held an important place in the universe. The club members then told us about the various events organized annually by them. I was impressed to know about the footfall at events like Acme and Ambit. They made the session even more interesting by showing us the reels that were made by them to spread word about the events. All of us were very happy and interested to join causmic club. <br/>
<br/>
Next, the anchor invited Mr. Gautam onstage who briefed us about motorsports and the world of racing. As a person who fondly watches Formula 1 racing, that session was pretty intriguing. Though, it was a short lecture, it was great to know the initiatives taken up by the teachers and students at the college to make it all inclusive. I was amazed to know that the motorsports teams from our college had participated in national level competitions like Baja. <br/>
<br/>
After the thrilling session, we were brought to a state of calm by Dr. Priya Darshini as she continued with her expert lecture on Universal Human Values. She spoke again about being happy and prosperous and how there is a difference between the needs of the body and the soul. She told us that the needs of our body were not to be confused with those of the soul. It was a very informative lecture all-in-all. <br/>
<br/>
Following the lectures in the auditorium and the break, all branches now had 2 classes. The scheduled classes of English and peer-to-peer Programming through problem solving using C++ of my section ECE-A were held in F-106. I sat with my new found friends and we listened intently as our English professor Mr. Aastik Sharma gave us four very interesting questions which revolved around our introduction and a letter to a friend. He then asked all of the students to, one-by-one, speak whatever they wrote in their introduction but without looking at the notebook. I was nervous at first, but then I spoke exactly what I had written and I felt confident. His class went by very fast. Next up, we had the PPS class which was conducted by our seniors from 2nd and 3rd year. They taught us to write our first C++ program. They were very kind and helping. After the hour-long class, we were now dismissed from the class and headed back home.<br/>

## Day 4: 5 August 2025
Today was a pretty short visit to the college since we only had 2 guest lectures. The day started off with the seniors of our college setting forth more information about the college, events, sports and a lot more so that we could know all that was needed to know about the college. Listening to the seniors was fun as they were speaking from experience which they lived just like us and started off their college lives a few years ago with questions in the mind and a nervous heart. All that they said felt relatable. <br/>
<br/>
To end the day, a very interesting lecture was held by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar who told us about the importance of millets in our daily diet. I never knew millets were such a super food and it was very amazing to know about the health benefits of millets. <br/>
<br/>
There was a lot to learn today. It was a good day. 

## Day 5: 6 August 2025
I was looking forward to today's lecture since the schedule shared yesterday night seemed to be pretty appealing. <br/>
First to begin the lectures was Dr. Parminder Singh, Dean, Student Welfare. He commenced his lecture which was full of details about the extra curriculars available inside the college premises. He told us about all the sports facilities that were present at the sports complex. I was surprised to know that there was a shooting range in the college. He then told us about the various scholarships and awards that the college presented to the students. Although Dr. Arvind had already briefed us about the societies and clubs active in the college, Dr. Parminder reiterated that for our information. <br/>
<br/>
Next up, the anchor invited Mr. Manpreet Singh on stage, whose lecture on "Fitness for Engineers" won hearts. He not only gave us health, fitness and food tips but also made sure that the youth of the college was not indulging in narcotic and alcohol consumption. He made the session very interactive by asking questions from the audience about health and wellness and many boys asked him their queries about gymming. His career story was very inspiring. On the whole, he gave a very informative and important lecture. <br/>
<br/>
After this, the NCC cadets took the stage. I have to say, the lecture given by Under Officer Tanmay Kaushal was very impressive. He told us all a lot about his own experience, the weaponry and machines NCC cadets get to use and he showed us the official website so that we could navigate easily and learn more about the National Cadet Corps. After his lecture, the host told us all to stand and applaud for the upcoming guest and it was thrilling to know that the guest was a very esteemed Army officer. Brigadier P.S. Cheema gave a very inspiring lecture. He told us to be efficient in whatever we do and to make sure we work for the 3 E's or the 2 S's which stood for Energy, Environment, Economy, Security and Social challenges. He recommended a book by Daniel Goleman - "Emotional Intelligence" and being an avid reader, I will read it. He kept the session very captivating with the poems and quotations and it felt very nice to be in the presence of such a respected person.<br/>
<br/>
After the break and the physics class by Prof. Amarjot Kaur, who told us about the syllabus and the marks distribution for the semester, we had a lecture by Mr. Gautam Murria on motorsports. Since I am an F1 fan, I enjoyed the lecture a lot.<br/>

## Day 6: 7 August 2025
Today's day set off with a physics and maths lecture. We had an introduction of LASERS in physics and a discussion on Differential Equations in Maths. After the classes and the break, we all headed to the auditorium for a couple lectures.<br/>
<br/>
The first lecture was given by Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khana, inharge, Centre of Multi-faceted Learning. He gave us all the information that was needed to know about the CML. His words were insightful and it was nice to listen to such a learned man.<br/>
<br/>
To conclude the day, Dr. Jasvir Singh Grewal, incharge, National Service Scheme gave a very enlightening lecture on the mission and work done by the NSS in the college. He gave us knowledge of the history and went on to tell the advantages that we would have on joining the NSS.<br/>
<br/>
Both the lectures were very deep and thoughtful and brought a nice end to the day. <br/>

## Day 7: 8 August 2025
Today, the first class was peer to peer learning in which our seniors gave us the opportunity to introduce ourselves in the class to help us boost our confidence. After the introductions, they re-assured us that they were there for our help if we needed any in our academics, clubs or extra-curriculars.<br/>
<br/>
Next, we went to the carpentry workshop for an introductory class. The teachers there gave us an introduction to all the workshops and told us what all we would do in carpentry. The sir present there also gave us basic knowledge of different types of woods and defects in them. It was very hot but the workshop was a different experience. <br/>
